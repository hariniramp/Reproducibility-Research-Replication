### Fixing typos

Small typos or grammatical errors in documentation may be edited directly using
the GitHub web interface, so long as the changes are made in the _source_ file.


### Prerequisites

Before you make a substantial pull request, you should always file an issue and
make sure someone from the team agrees that it’s a problem. If you’ve found a
bug, create an associated issue and illustrate the bug with a minimal 
[reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex).

### Pull request process

*  We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).   
*  New code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org).
You can use the [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to
apply these styles, but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with 
your PR.  
*  We use [Markdown syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/markdown.html), 
for documentation.  
* Contributions with test cases included are easier to accept.
